This is a simple, yet optimized parking reservation system written in Django.
in order to get the program running just do the following:

1 - python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

2 - migrate the database

and then just run the project.

for any requests other than user register or login requests you should first send a request to the auth-token api,
and use the bearer token in every api requests.

This project is only the backend system of the parking reservation system.. You are welcome to add any front end
system to the project or any changes and contributions you'd like.
